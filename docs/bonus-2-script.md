# Legacy Code

## Intro (15s)

Hello, I'm Chris Krycho, and this is the New Rustacean podcast---a 15--20 minute
show about learning the Rust programming language. This is **Bonus Episode 2:
Legacy Code**

## Talk (6-8m)

- Talking with a colleague about changes we're making to a codebase right now.
- History: all but one major job or contract == maintenance.
- The problem: a lot of times, legacy code is a mess.
- The temptation: FIX ALL THE THINGS!!!
- The other problem: stuff (usually, for the most part) actually works now
- The solution: clean up your mess as you go. Be a good Boy Scout.
