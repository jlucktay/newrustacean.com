# Building as a Community

## Intro (30s -> 0:30)

Hello, I'm Chris Krycho, and this is the New Rustacean podcast---a show about learning the Rust programming language.
This is **Bonus Episode 3: Building as a Community**.

Normal episodes are 15--20 minutes long, but bonus episodes like this one are a bit shorter---usually under 10 minutes.
I took a one-week long 8--5-every-day class three weeks ago, and then started a new job two weeks ago, which included
getting trapped in New York City by a once-a-century blizzard, so I have not had time to put together quite as
technical a talk as usual. But today's topic, community, is just as important for whether Rust succeeds in the long
term--- maybe even more important---than some of the technical details we talk about week in and week out.

## Talk (6-8m)

- **A story (2m):** learning Fortran
- **Another story (2m):** learning Rust
- **Takeaways (4m):**

  1. Community matters even for building something big and complicated, and you don't have to be a jerk to get really
    amazing results. Quite the opposite, in fact. (elaborate: Rust, Elixir, etc.``)

  2. Building *as* a community matters as well. It's great that we're kind to each other---really great. But we should
    also actively help each other. This is true of any project you want to succeed. You'd be surprised how much
    open-source projects need help, and how often you're actually one of the best people *to* help. If you see a
    problem, you are often in the best position to fix it simply because you know the pain point.

    And if you have a good community, like we do in Rust, people will help you help them. Ask around, look at lists of
    issues, etc.---and even if an issue marked "easy" looks too daunting, give it a go. Find a project that looks
    interesting, or useful, and offer to help. People will help you learn what you need to know to solve that problem.
    You'll grow, the project will be in better shape, and it'll be a win all around.

## Closing (1m 30s -> TODO)

Next time, we're going to go for a high-level but extremely important discussion about type systems, both in general
and specifically in Rust. Since Rust's type system is such a big part of its interest, and one of a few things that
distinguishes it from languages like C or Java, I think it'll be fun and interesting to talk about that in a bit more
detail.
