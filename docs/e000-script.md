# e000: Hello, world!

"Hello! I'm Chris Krycho, and this is the New Rustacean podcast---a 15--20 minute show about learning the Rust
programming language."

- Usual show format, this episode format (3 minutes)
  - Usual: any important news or follow-up (<5 minutes), then one or two topics of interest from what I've been
    learning, always with code samples available on the site and GitHub. It will be roughly weekly, but life does
    happen occasionally!

    I'm going to assume a basic working knowledge of programming, and along with it a basic knowledge of the command
    line, etc. I'm treating this as a podcast about being new to *Rust*, not new to *programming*. If you're interested
    in a show more about being new to programming in general, they're out there---and specifically, you can listen to
    Sap.py, the podcast I do with my wife as she's learning Python! On this, show, however, the focus is on Rust.

  - Today: you'll hear a little bit about me, then a lot about Rust!

- Me (3 minutes)
  - Software
    - modeling networks of neurons in the brain, avionics, hazards modeling, web development
    - Fortran, C, maintained some awful C++, Python
    - Web: PHP, Node.js, Angular, SQL, and of course lots of HTML, CSS, plain old JavaScript, SASS, etc.
  - Seminary "Master of Divinity, which is a *hilarious* title"

- Rust
  - What is it? (6 minutes)
    - Systems programming language
    - Memory safe. Really. No segfaults in safe code. And the vast majority of Rust code is safe code (e.g. Cargo: all
      safe!).
    - High-level design (inferred types, functional programming, generics, traits, metaprogramming via hygienic
      macros)---it's a descendant of ML (like OCaml or F♯), and it shows.
    - > To put it simply: it’s low-level in its ability to address the computer, and high-level in the abstractions it
      > hands to a programmer.

  - What *isn't* it? (3 minutes)
    - A particularly beginner-friendly language. You *could* learn it as your first language, but I wouldn't
      necessarily recommend it. The language itself is relatively demanding, and the documentation is, too. It's
      possible, but I'd start with Python, Ruby, or JavaScript instead.
    - As of *today*, it isn't a classical "object oriented" language in the way that people tend to think of those
      things (i.e. in Java, C++, or C♯). It can *do* most of the same things, but it tackles the problems that
      inheritance is meant to solve in different ways. That said, inheritance is in the pipes: having more tools is
      good!

  - Why do I care? (3 minutes)
    - Time hunting bugs caused by memory leaks. Lots of it.
    - Writing in Python, etc.: integrating with Rust for performant code instead of C sounds *awesome*.
    - Performant, cross-platform back end for software I want to write
    - I just *like* it.
  - Why should *you* care? Well, all of the above reasons. If that hasn't persuaded you... just try it and see what you
    think! I find it a really *fun* language.
