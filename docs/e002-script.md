# e002: Something borrowed, something... moved?

## Intro (30s)

Hello, I'm Chris Krycho, and this is the New Rustacean podcast---a 15--20 minute
show about learning the Rust programming language. This is episode 2: "Something
borrowed, something... moved?"

## News (4m)

- `rustfmt` -- a tool for formatting Rust code
  - [repo](https://github.com/nrc/rustfmt)
  - ["rustfmt-ing Rust`](http://www.ncameron.org/blog/rustfmt-ing-rust/)
  - [Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/3nt2vm/rustfmting_rust_please_help_me_rustfmt_the_rust/)

- Open RFC for incremental compilation -- valuable to decrease iteration time,
  especially on large projects (and available to other comparable languages).
  Right now, Rust compiles the entirety of a given "crate" (package)

  - [RFC issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1298)
  - [RFC text](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/rfcs/blob/incremental-compilation/text/0000-incremental-compilation.md)

### About RFCs

Rust, like several other communities (EmberJS), discusses suggested changes to
the  language and tooling via "RFCs", i.e. "requests for comment". People submit
a PR with a detailed proposal, the tradeoffs, etc. and then the community
discusses it. Once accepted, implementation.

## `struct` types (5m)

### Concepts

- Data structures are fundamental
- The kinds of structures you and have and what they can do empower/limit you.
  - True of language constructs in general: can you have standalone
    functions, or do they have to belong to a class (_a la_ Java, Câ™¯, etc.)
  - Can you associate behavior with them (classes in classical languages,
    objects in e.g. JS)?
  - How do they relate to each other?
    - Classical inheritance
    - Prototypal inheritance
    - Mixins/traits
- Two basic type constructors in Rust: `struct` and `enum`; today, focus on
  `structs` (the simpler of the two). Also tuples.
- No inheritance (yet)

### Use

- `struct`s have _members_
- Members can be any type: primitives, other `struct`s, functions
- Roughly like C++ or Java classes in many ways, but without inheritance, and
  - Rust has no header/source distinction as in C++
    - use documentation tools, etc. instead of reaidng header files. Cf.
      Python's `help` etc.
  - but implementation still separate from definition (in `impl` blocks)
- Double colon notation for methods
- Dot notation for member access

## Borrowing and Moving (7m)

### Concepts

- A core problem in languages with memory management is knowing the state of
  a given piece of data
- "Shared mutable state is the root of all evil"
- Rust addresses via "ownership"
  - unlimited immutable references
  - max one mutable reference
- When handing data to one function from another, the data can be _borrowed_
  or _moved_.
- If you _borrow_ data, you get a "reference".
  - Not the same as other languages---though some similarities under the
    covers
  - Means you don't _own_ it, you just have access to it at some level. When
    done, control goes back to caller (owner)
- If you _move_ data, you get _ownership_.
  - You can do anything allowed by mutability rules of the type in the new
    owner.
  - On exiting the new owner's scope, the object is _dropped_---memory is
    de-allocated.
  - As a result, original owner can't access it anymore.

### Use

- References use `&`.
- The `*` operator dereferences, allowing you to assign new values to the
  referenced element (e.g. a new `struct` instance entirely, not just
  operating on the internals of a given `struct`).
  - But as always, only for mutable references.
  - It does a bit more than that, too; we'll come back to that in the future
    when we talk about traits.
- Moves happen in function calls when using non-reference types
- Can use `move` keyword to specify moves in other contexts as well -- more on
  that in a future episode (when I understand it better myself!)

It's both _like_ and _unlike_ C/C++/etc.

## Closing (1m)

### Next time

- Another data structure type: `Enum`s!
- The associated notion of pattern matching---one of the most powerful
  concepts in Rust.
- Meaningful, safe return values from functions which might fail
