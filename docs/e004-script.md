# Functionalized

## Intro (30s)

Hello, I'm Chris Krycho, and this is the New Rustacean podcast---a 15--20 minute show about learning the Rust
programming language. This is episode 4: Functionalized.

## News (2m)

First up, thanks for sending in more pull requests!

- Thanks to kstep (Konstantin Stepanov), Dashed (Alberto  Leal) and ctjhoa (Camille TCHOA) for fixing some links in the
  show notes.

- Thanks to zazdxscf (Emanuel Czirai) for pointing out some problems in the code samples from last week!

- Thanks to David Krycho (yep, that's my dad!) for asking me some good questions about last week's episode content and
  show notes, which have led to some improvements I'll push up to the example code sometime later this week!

Second, progress continues apace on the IDEs I mentioned last week: the IntelliJ IDEA folks have made a *ton* of
progress since I recorded, and though you have to build the plugin yourself, it does support some of the basic syntax
highlighting functionality and the like.

Third, a few more learning tools you might find handy:

- Exercism.io has some Rust exercises (HT: Lechindianer on GitHub/Tw/ADN)
- Camille TCHOA's GitHub repository rust-learning
- If you speak German, rustplatz.de. I can't read a word of it, but it looks like there's some solid stuff on there

## Overview (3m)

Last week, I said we were going to talk about functions, methods, and closures, and that's sort of true. However, to
talk about functions in Rust, we're going to have to spend a little time talking about *types* as well, and that means
we're not going to get quite as far in our discussion of functions as I originally thought.

Today, after getting our feet under us a bit with what we actually mean when talking about "functions" both in general
and also in Rust specifically, we'll cover the very basics of how Rust handles normal functions, methods, and closures.
We'll conclude by showing how some of those conceptual issues come into play by showing how you can pass around
functions as arguments, precisely because functions are just another type in Rust. Next week, we'll pick up and carry
on with the idea of *returning* functions, and see how that leads us further into the type system and into how Rust
manages memory.

## Functions (High Level) (5m)

Functions: building blocks of sane programming practice. Who *hasn't* seen nightmare code where functions were
thousands of lines long and did dozens of different things?

How functions work, and what they are in the language, make a huge difference in how your language feels and what kinds
of things are normal in it.

- Are functions first-class members of the language, at the same level as any other object (whether an integer or a
  struct/class/etc. instance)?
- How hard/easy is it to use functions in composition?
- Are there anonymous functions?
- Are there closures?
- Are there methods?
- Are there non-method functions?
- Can you define functions inside other functions?
- Do functions have types, and can you use those types the way you can use other types in the language?

How your language answers these questions determines what kind of language you have. For example:

- Old-fashioned Fortran has *subroutines* more than it does *functions*. They are capable... as subroutines. But
  they're not high-level functions, at all.
- C and Java, for all their differences, answer many of these questions the same way. The main way they differ are in
  having methods. Neither can *really* treat functions the same way they treat, say, integers.
- Python and Ruby, by contrast, have functions that can be assigned and managed just like any other type in the
  language. In Python, functions are objects, which can have methods attached! However, Python doesn't really expose
  the *type* of the function in a way that you can use (as indeed it doesn't with *any* types, relying philosophically
  on duck typing instead).
- In Haskell and ML-descended languages (OCaml, F#, and Rust!), functions have types, and can be used as such.

## Functions in Rust (3m)

- A theme of Rust is *strong, static typing*. Nearly everything in the language has a type, which is known at compile
  time---functions included!
- Basic components of the type of a given function are its argument types and return types.
- Talk more about types in the future, because those types can be further constrained in various ways.
- Methods are a special case of ordinary functions: and (from what I understand so far) they only get special behavior
  when passed a reference to

## Closures (2m)

Big difference with closures from functions (anonymous functions) is that they capture their environment. Use slightly
different syntax to emphasize this.

- Gets into ownership and another Rust concept, *lifetimes*, because they maintain access to elements defined in their
  scope.
- One way of doing information hiding (and easily the most common in e.g. JS).

Closures and functions both implement the `Fn` `trait`. (This is one of the ways that types can be constrained and
defined!) We'll talk more about traits now; today suffice it to say that traits make up the basic way of defining
conformity to a given interface---*a la* mixins, protocols, and interfaces in other languages.

## Functions as arguments (3m)

- Both normal functions and closures can be passed as arguments.
- Closures particularly useful for two reasons:
  - They can be defined where the function call happens, so for brief definitions this can be clearer (e.g. `map` or
    `reduce` on an array).

  - As noted a minute ago, they can bring their environment with them.

    Scenario: say you have a function that expects a function taking one argument as a callback, but you need to do
    some manipulation in the function you pass in using data in your *current* environment. Two alternatives:

    1. Use a closure directly, where you just have access to the local data you need without passing it as arguments.
    2. Create a factory to build the function you need... by creating and returning a closure. This is a bit more
      complicated, but there are times when it's the best way to approach the situation---especially when the body is
      complicated, or when you need to build similar functions repeatedly.

- To define a function taking a function as an argument, you just supply the *type* of the function as a `trait`. Then
  the operation is *generic*: it can operate using any function that matches the constraints defined by that trait.

  See the code samples to get an idea of how this works in more detail.

## Closing (1m)

### Next time

Last week, I said we'd get all the way through functions and into the stack and the heap, but as it turns out, there is
a *lot* to cover in functions. So, next time we'll pick up from here and talk about returning functions, and *that*
will lead us into a discussion of the stack and the heap, and possibly---but no guarantees!---into some early
discussion of functional programming.
